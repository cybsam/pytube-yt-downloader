# Python YouTube Video Downloader
Pytube Overview and Installation.
Pytube is a small, dependency-free Python module for accessing videos from the internet.

The native library is not pytube – you must first install it to be able to use it. When you have pip, installation is simple.

To install Pytube using pip, you will need to open your command prompt CLI as an administrator and enter the following command:
```bash
$ pip install pytube
```
The pytube library improves video downloads. Build the YouTube module's object by supplying the URL as a parameter. Then, obtain the video's proper extension and resolution. You can change the name of the file at your leisure – otherwise, the original name will be retained.

### How to use:-
Download or clone git repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cybsam/pytube-yt-downloader.git
```
Go to your git clone or download folder then
```bash
python3 main.py
```
```bash
Enter the YouTube video URL:
```

Now Enjoy...
